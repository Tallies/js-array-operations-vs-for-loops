# Array Method Operations vs For Loops
## Introduction
The repository is meant as an training resource for learning how to change common JavaScript/TypeScript for loops patterns into Array method operations. The idempotent array method operations are generally more readable and succinct. 

These example exercises were used as part of a [NML](https://nml.co.za) "Learning Channel" session.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
1. Install [deno](https://deno.land).
1. Run an exercise script with `deno <SCRIPT_NAME>` to see output, for example: `deno 001.hasNine.js`.
1. Modify the exercise scripts to use only the targeted array method operations below, without looking at the reference scripts.
1. Run the exercise script again as per step 3.

## Array Method Operations
The following array method operations are targeted in these exercises:
* every
* filter
* find
* findIndex
* flat
* flatMap
* map
* reduce
* reduceRight
* slice
* some

Documentation on all these array methods can be found [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

 ## Structure
 The `ref` folder contains the answers for each of the exercises. Where alternatives or cleaner code are available, they have been added as commented code.
 
 The `data` folder contains simple data structures used by the exercises and reference implementations.
 
 `000.array.js` - Background examples on array construction, common mutating array methods, and for loops.
 
 `001.` - `011.` - Exercise for converting for loops to single array method operations.
 
 `012.` - `014.` - More complicated exercises where more than one array method operation will be needed.
